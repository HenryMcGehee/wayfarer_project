                I am very fortunate to have had the chance to work with Nathan and Henry for this project. It has been a
                pleasure to learn from them and pick their brains. What we were able to accomplish this
                week motivated to become a better developer. I'm thankful for this experience and will continue to take
                what I've learned this past week and apply it to my future career.

                I enjoyed working on a team for this project as together we persevered through challenges and discovered
                new ways to develop with Django. Through this project we all learned how to use Django on a wholistic
                level. Iâ€™m grateful for our team which have made this a memorable experience.

                Our team worked well together with minimal issues. We were able to knock out all of our intended
                features at a relativly quick pace. The major features were developed using peer programming. This
                assured that we built our site on a strong foundation. After we met the project requirements and reached
                feature lock, we broke off on our own to polish the user experience and site design.
